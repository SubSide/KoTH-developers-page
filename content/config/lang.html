<h3 id="multiplelines">Using multiple lines</h3>
<p>With the exception of a couple, it is possible to make the messages in the lang.json use multiple lines.<br />
You can make a lot of cool messages like the one below!
<br /><br />
<img src="/KoTH/images/multiplelines.png" alt="Multiple lines" />
<br /><br />
Anyway, lets get right to it.<br />
<h4>Multiple lines</h4>
To make a message multiple lines, you need to make an array out of it.<br />
<pre>
{
  "PLAYING": {
    "STARTING": "&aThe koth %koth% has begun!",
    "CAPTIME": "&a%player% is capping the koth! %minutes_left%:%seconds_left% left!",
    "LEFT": "&a%player% left the koth!",
    "....": "&a...."
  }
}
</pre>
<br class="clear" />
You surround a json array with [square brackets],<br />
then you separate every message by a comma,
<br />
<pre>
{
"PLAYING": {
      "STARTING": [
        "&a&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;",
        "&a&#9608;&0&#9608;&a&#9608;&0&#9608;&a&#9608;",
        "&a&#9608;&#9608;&0&#9608;&a&#9608;&#9608; The koth %koth% has begun!",
        "&a&#9608;&#9608;&0&#9608;&a&#9608;&#9608;",
        "&a&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;"
      ],
      "CAPTIME": "&a%player% is capping the koth! %minutes_left%:%seconds_left% left!",
      "LEFT": [
        "&aOh no!",
        "&a%player% left the Koth!"
      ],
      "....": "&a...." 
    }
  }
</pre>
<br class="clear" />
<h4 id="validate">Validate it!</h4>
JSON can be pretty picky if the syntax isn't correctly.<br />
If the syntax isn't correct it cannot read the file and it resets the file.<br />
So make sure you check if it is valid!<br />
