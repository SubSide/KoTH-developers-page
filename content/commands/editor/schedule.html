    <p>Now this is a hell of a long command, and I know it. Luckily most of the arguments are not nessesary.</p>
    <p>
        Let me explain a bit what the default values are for every command. And what they do.<br />
        This way I don't have to explain those down below in the edit section.
    </p>
    <p>If it's easier, you can choose to only use the required arguments, and just edit it later with the edit command.</p>
    <section>
        <h4>&lt;koth&gt;</h4>
        <p>This one should speak for itself, which Koth should run on this time.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>&lt;day&gt;</h4>
        <p>The day of the week (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday)</p>
        <p>You can use a comma to make it easier to schedule multiple at once. (Don't use a space, so "Monday,Friday")</p>
        <p>You can also use "daily", meaning it will automatically create 7 schedules for you, each day of the week.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>&lt;time&gt;</h4>
        <p>The time the koth should take place.</p>
        <p>You can use a comma to make it easier to schedule multiple at once. (Don't use a space, so "14:00,10AM")</p>
        <p>Syntax is just 4:30PM or 21:50, or 5AM, just don't use spaces and you should be good. AM just doesn't do anything really, and PM just adds 12 to it (Except for 12, because you americans are that weird to not just add 12 to everything (jk jk))</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>[capturetime]</h4>
        <p>The time a player has to stand on the koth to capture it.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>[maxruntime]</h4>
        <p>
            The maximum amount of minutes a koth can run. If it is being capped at the moment this timer runs out, it will wait till the player has capped it, or when he gets knocked off.
            If he gets knocked off when the timer already ran out, it will immediately end it.
        </p>
        <p><b>Default:</b> -1 (disabled)</p>

    <section>
        <h4>[lootamount]</h4
