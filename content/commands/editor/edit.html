        <p>
            With the area command you can define and remove new areas.	Meaning you can have multiple areas a player could stand in to capture.
        </p>
        <p>
            A nice way to see it is to imagine two towers. Now the player can go in one of the towers to cap it.	The other players have to guess in which tower he is to actually get him off the capture zone.
            Now imagine 20 capture zones! You could make like a maze! :P
        </p>
        <p>
            There is not really a limit on how many areas you can select, the servers performance is your limit!
        </p>

        <small>
            When a koth is running, you could edit the areas, and it would take immediate effect!

        <h4>/koth edit <abbr title="required">&lt;koth&gt;</abbr> area create <abbr title="required">&lt;area&gt;</abbr></h4>
        <p>
            This command creates new capture zones with the given name for players to stand in.
            Just like with creating the koth in the first place, you must have an area selected with worldedit.
