    <p>Hello, this is a little website that I made to help you with setting up and editing your koths.</p>
    <p>I put a lot of effort in it, so I hope it will help you!</p>
    <p>
        Link to the SpigotMC page:<br/>

    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any trouble with setting it up, or have any questions,<br/>
        you can always contact me on skype, or message me on SpigotMC.

        When I offer to help ingame, my IGN is SubSideNL, make sure that is correct.

    <h2>Koth editor commands</h2>
    <p>For these commands you need the permission: <b>koth.admin.edit</b></p>
    <h5>The koth editor commands are:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#create">create</a></li>
        <li><a href="#remove">remove</a></li>
    </ul>
</header>
<section>
    <h3 id="area"> /koth edit <abbr title="required">&lt;koth&gt;</abbr> area </h3>
    <p> With the area command you can define and remove new areas. Meaning you can have multiple areas a player could
        stand in to capture.
    </p>

    <small>
        A kind of neat thing is, that when a koth is running, you could edit the areas, and it would take
        immediate effect!
